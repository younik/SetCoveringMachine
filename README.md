# Set Covering Machine

The Set Covering Machine is a learning algorithm for binary classification. The classifier is a solution of the set cover problem minimizing the empirical risk.

This implementation follow the idea presented in the original paper: 
![Marchand, Mario & Shawe-Taylor, John & Brodley, E. & Danyluk, Andrea. (2003). The Set Covering Machine. Journal of Machine Learning Research. 3. 10.1162/jmlr.2003.3.4-5.723. ](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/marchand02a/marchand02a.pdf)

So the *sets* are *balls* generated from the training set and the set cover problem is solved using greedy algorithm (Chv√°tal, 1979), accordingly to the paper. Sets can be combined in conjunction or disjunction and this can be specified using the parameter *machine_type*.

## How to install

You can install the package using pip:

    pip install scmpy

## Example
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.datasets import make_circles
    from scmpy import SCM

    # make some artificial data
    X, y = make_circles(n_samples=200, noise=0.2, factor=0.5, random_state=666)

    # split data in train and test
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = \
        train_test_split(X, y, test_size=.3, random_state=7)

    scm = SCM(machine_type="disjunction")

    # fit the model
    scm.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # now the model is fitted, we can predict values

    # print accuracy
    print(scm.score(X_test, y_test))
